# elm-get

A command line tool to share Elm libraries. Currently in pre-release, only for testing!

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/evancz/elm-get.git
cd elm-get
cabal install
```

This will install the `elm-get` executable in `/home/YOU/.cabal/bin`.

Ease of install will improve when this is properly released!
